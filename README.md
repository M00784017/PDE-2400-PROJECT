# PDE-2400-PROJECT
LEDs
Students will be writing code related to an engineering project, and submit regularly 
to a dedicated repository. The final version of their software will be demonstrated via 
video submission to the instructors at week 18.
Students will have to write Python code for creating an original light animation on 6 
LED bars.
What has been done:
Week 12: 
-Created github account and made a new repository.
-Started researching fadecandy and trying out some simple examples to see how it works
Week 13:
-Started working on my first project trial with basic functions and animations, and received feedback from Denis regarding that.
-Made some changes to function names and removing the 'return' in each function as it was not necessary.
-Submitted several commits and changes over the week.

# PDE-2400-PROJECT
#####Libraries used
1## simulator
The simulator has 360 built in leds in 6 rows and each row contains 60 leds.
LEDs.
2##import opc
Calls out the simulator
##from time import sleep
Imports sleep from time because we dont need the whole library
3##import colorsys
Used to integrate hsv value and saturation to some animations
4##import random
Used to shuffle random colors or colors between a specified range, eg: random.radint(0,255)

#####functions used
Each function of a country is named for drawing up the flag of it.
Function 1 is named Palestine, and it displays the flag of palestine
Function 2 is the flag of England and it uses an animation to draw up the flag.
Function 3 is the flag of Ireland.
Function 4 is the flag of Ukraine.
Function 5 is the flag of Germany.
Function 6 is the flag of Armenia.
Function 7 is the flag of Brazil.
Function 8 is the options function. In here, the UI is implemented so that 
the user has 7 choices to pick between using numbers. If the user inputs an 
invalid character or a number, the ui reports an error and asks the user to input a valid number between 1 and 7.

Function 9 is the user function. This is the second part of the animation and it is a simple one. The code asks the user 
to input the country they are in. After that, it asks for the weather in this country using 4 choices and displays an animation based on the input.

Function 10 is the More Animations function and in here there are 3 nice animations for the user to pick from. I tried my best to make the animations good and creative and different.
















































Students will be writing code related to an engineering project, and submit regularly 
to a dedicated repository. The final version of their software will be demonstrated via 
video submission to the instructors at week 18.
Students will have to write Python code for creating an original light animation on 6 
LED bars.
What has been done:
Week 12: 
-Created github account and made a new repository.
-Started researching fadecandy and trying out some simple examples to see how it works
Week 13:
-Started working on my first project trial with basic functions and animations, and received feedback from Denis regarding that.
-Made some changes to function names and removing the 'return' in each function as it was not necessary.
-Submitted several commits and changes over the week.
